              The academy’s selection is solely based on the information provided in the application form. If the academy finds out that you have merely provided misleading information or overlooked important information, it maintains the right to deny admission.

              <li>
                All fee payments made to the academy, be it the course fee or the application fee, are non-refundable.
              </li>
              <li>
                The fee is also non-refundable if the student decides to drop out of the course in the middle. This is exactly why we have created a monthly payment structure so that people who change their minds just have to forfeit one month’s price.
              </li>
              <li>
                The academy has the authority to raise the fee at any time during the course. A fee increase will, however, be notified one month in advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students are required to pay the monthly fee before the 28th of each month.
              </li>
              <li>
                A student can elect to leave the Academy at any time. However, the management must be given prior notice at least one week before the start of the following month.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our payment system does not allow us to reverse the transaction, so only complete your payment if you are certain you will not back out.

              If due to any reason, the student is not able to attend a class, in NO manner will this class be compensated. Unforeseen events may emerge during the student’s course of study, and these should be treated with constructive understanding and patience.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-7">
              However, if it’s a miss from our side, then we’ll compensate the class for you based on mutual agreement. Technical limitations are a part of online learning. A student might be unable to attend a class due to technical difficulty (either on the student’s or the teacher’s end). In such situations, send us an email or a WhatsApp message and leave the class. If there was a technical problem on the part of the teacher, the missed class will be compensated.
